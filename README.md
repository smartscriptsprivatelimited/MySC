### üè¢ About the Client

**Mr. Hitesh Kangariya** contacted us with a dream to create a solid online presence for his **NDIS** support service business. Being an approved NDIS service provider, the client needed a professional and accessible website to showcase their values of care, support, and community inclusion.

The goal was to create a business website that is informative, aesthetically pleasing, and constructed to foster trust and interaction among individuals and families looking for NDIS services in Australia.

- Make it simple for visitors to discover support options and contact you
- Ensure mobile responsiveness and SEO-friendly design
- Keep it fast-loading, secure, and easily manageable

### üöß Challenges

The main challenge with this project was design. The site had to balance professionalism with warmth, and be accessible and inclusive for all potential users, including families with disabilities and their families. Furthermore, NDIS service websites are required to generate trust, simplicity, and compliance‚Äîall without becoming too clinical or corporate.

- WordPress CMS for simplicity and scalability
- Elementor for adaptable, visually appealing page construction
- Astra Theme for speed, customizability, and minimalist design

We worked closely with Mr. Hitesh to get a sense of the tone of the brand and target audience. Based on his feedback, we designed a website that includes:

- Easily segmented service pages with in-depth information
- Effective calls-to-action for simple enquiries
- A soothing and accessible color scheme with clear typography
- Contact forms and rapid navigation to improve user experience
- SEO-friendly design to enhance search engine visibility

**Major Features Implemented**

- Accessibility-aware design to comply with NDIS guidelines
### üìà Results
